# Dice Games 

Simulated a game of craps in C++ using random dice demonstrated to have a variance of 1/12.

Also demonstrated that the dice roll distribution gets more Gausian as the number of iterations increases.

Additionally modeled upto 20 rolls in a row and determined the average round reached and average win rate. The round reached was 3.4465±0.7907 experimentally and 3.4075±0.7476 for the expected and the win rate was 47.870±4.589% for the experimental and 48.102±4.637% for
the expected.
