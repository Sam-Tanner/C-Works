# Technical Demonstrations

This section holds three different tasks, all in seperate parts of code.

E1 - Defined and used a class known as Circles, overloading operators such as addition, output and larger than and demonstrating their use.

E2 - Used adresses and pointers to transpose a matrix by only swapping values under the diagonal (i,j) to (j,i) where j<i for example.

E3 - Simulated a disease outbreak using a custom class to hold whether an individual is infected, immune and alive (boolean to reduce memory) and allowed for alive individuals to meet and possibly infect one another.
The chance of someone infecting someone else whom isnâ€™t immune is 50%, the chance of recovery is 12% per day and the mortality rate when infected is 1% per day. This lead to the results shown in 'Year_of_infections.png'.
